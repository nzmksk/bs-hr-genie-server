# Docker Guideline

This guideline provides instructions and best practices for using Docker in your project.

## Prerequisites

- Docker: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project using Docker.

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/nzmksk/bs-hr-genie-server).
2. Clone your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <forked-repository-url>
   cd <your-repository-directory>
   ```
3. Build the Docker image and run the containers:
   ```bash
   make server-up
   ```
   The server will run on port `2000` while the database and Redis will run on port `35432` and `6379` respectively.

## Other Useful Commands

- To stop the server:
  ```bash
  make server-down
  ```
- To stop the server and reset database:
  ```bash
  make server-down-reset
  ```
- To run node.js terminal:
  ```bash
  make node-terminal
  ```
- To run PSQL CLI:
  ```bash
  make psql-cli
  ```
- To run Redis CLI:
  ```bash
  make redis-cli
  ```
- To read the logs of server, database, or Redis:
  ```bash
  make log-server
  make log-db
  make log-redis
  ```

# API Guideline

## Base URL

The base URL for all API endpoints is `http://localhost:2000/api/v1`

## Authentication

Authentication is required for accessing `[protected]` endpoints. The authentication is based on [JWT (JSON Web Token)](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#readme). To authenticate requests, include the access token in the `Authorization` header of each request with the `Bearer` scheme. The token should be provided after the `Bearer` keyword.\
\
Example GET request to protected endpoints in Dart:

```Dart
   final endpoint = "/protected_endpoint";
   final headers = {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Authorization": "Bearer <your-access-token>",
   };

   final http.Response response = await http.get(
      Uri.parse("$baseUrl$endpoint"),
      headers: headers,
   );
```

Access and refresh tokens can be obtained from the [`/login`](#post-login) or [`/refresh_token`](#post-refresh_token-protected) endpoints. Please note that expired or invalid tokens will result in a `400 Bad Request` or `401 Unauthorized` response.\
\
**Error Examples:**

- Error: 400 Bad Request\
  Access token expired. Example response:
  ```JSON
  {
     "error": "Access token expired. Please refresh your token."
  }
  ```
  Upon receiving this error, you should **refresh your token by presenting your refresh token** to [`/refresh_token`](#post-refresh_token-protected) endpoint using `POST` request.
- Error: 401 Unauthorized\
  Access token was not included in request header. Example response:
  ```JSON
  {
     "error": "Authorization header missing."
  }
  ```
- Error: 401 Unauthorized\
  Access token was invalid or blacklisted. Access token can be blacklisted after a client is logging out or logging in from another device. Example response:
  ```JSON
  {
     "error": "Authentication failed."
  }
  ```
- Error: 403 Forbidden\
  Access token is valid but the client does not have authorization over the data requested. Example response:
  ```JSON
  {
     "error": "Access denied."
  }
  ```

[Next: /first_login](#post-first_login-protected)

### POST /login

This endpoint is used for user authentication and obtaining access and refresh tokens. **Access token will be send in JSON format** while the **refresh token is sent as a cookie**.

**Request**\
The request should include the following parameters in the request body:
| Parameter | Data Type | Restrictions | Option |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| email | string | Max 50 characters | Required |
| password | string | Must be 12 digits | Required |

Example request:

```Dart
   final endpoint = "/login";
   final headers = { "Content-Type": "application/json" };
   final body = {
      "email": "example@domain.com",
      "password": "123456789012",
   };

   final http.Response response = await http.post(
      Uri.parse("$baseUrl$endpoint"),
      headers: headers,
      body: jsonEncode(body),
   );
```

**Response**

- Success: 200 OK\
  The login was successful. The response body will contain the user's data, a success message, and an access token. Example response:

  ```JSON
  {
     "data": {
         "departmentId": "HR",
         "employeeId": "HR001",
         "employeeRole": "employee",
         "firstName": "John",
         "lastName": "Doe",
         "gender": "male",
         "email": "example@domain.com",
         "position": "Junior Software Engineer",
         "hashedPassword": "<hashed_password>",
         "isPasswordUpdated": false,
         "phone": "0123456789",
         "nric": "123456789012",
         "isMarried": false,
         "joinedDate": "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
         "profileImage": null,
         "isLoggedIn": false,
         "createdAt": "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
         "lastLogin": null,
         "cleanedEmail": "example@domain.com"
      },
      "message": "Authentication successful.",
      "token": "<your-access-token>"
  }
  ```

  You should keep both access and refresh tokens in a storage, i.e. local storage, session storage, or cookies, depending on your system requirements.\
  \
  If the client's request was made by a browser, the refresh token, which was sent by the server as a cookie, is saved automatically by most modern browsers. However, **if the request was made from a mobile app, you have to extract the cookie manually** by adding some codes.\
  \
  Here's an example in Dart:

  ```Dart
   final http.Response response = await http.post(
      Uri.parse("$baseUrl$endpoint"),
      headers: headers,
      body: jsonEncode(body),
   );

   final rawCookie = response.headers["Set-Cookie"];
   if (rawCookie != null) {
      // Store the cookie (refresh token) in your desired storage
   }
  ```

- Error: 400 Bad Request\
  Superadmin and admin accounts are not accessible via the API. Example response:

  ```JSON
  {
     "error": "Please login using the admin site."
  }
  ```

- Error: 401 Unauthorized\
  The provided credentials were invalid. Example response:
  ```JSON
  {
     "error": "Invalid password."
  }
  ```
- Error: 401 Unauthorized\
  The account was dormant due to employee's termination or resignation. Example response:
  ```JSON
  {
     "error": "Account is dormant. Please contact admin for further assistance.",
  }
  ```
- Error: 404 Not Found\
  The request was invalid or missing required parameters. Example response:
  ```JSON
  {
     "error": "Email does not exist. Please contact admin."
  }
  ```
- Error: 500 Internal Server Error\
  The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. Example response:
  ```JSON
  {
     "error": "Internal server error."
  }
  ```
